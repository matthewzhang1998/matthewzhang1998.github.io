I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, advised by [Prof. Murat Erdogdu](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~erdogdu/). I am also affiliated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). In 2025, I visited [Prof. Sinho Chewi](https://chewisinho.github.io/) at Yale University. In 2023, I visited [Prof. Santosh Vempala](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. In 2022, I visited Prof. Alain Durmus at ENS Paris-Saclay. 

I am interested in **sampling**, optimal transport and high dimensional probability. In particular, my research focuses on the complexity of sampling algorithms, as well as other statistical problems in high dimensions.

Previously I was a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, supervised by [Prof. Murat Erdogdu](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~erdogdu/) and [Prof. Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/). Before that, I was an undergraduate student in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto.

I also enjoy traveling and learning about different languages and cultures.
